# SPR

Concentration has never been my strong point, that being said; programming requires concentration and reading, 
and I am a programmer, so why not create tooling which aides me in my work and makes my life easier.

That is how SPR came about, influenced by [Stutter](), [Ratatui and Orhun's amazing work]() 
along with the likes of [TJ De'vries]() and [Neovim]() workflows.

The idea is that we need to read **a lot**, why not make it easier to do so on the command line.

The tool takes:
  - **Text** from the command line
  - ~~**Text** from STDIN~~
  - **Text** from files and various file types

The tool does:
  - Display inline within a TUI
  - Display fullscreen
  - Various reading speeds
