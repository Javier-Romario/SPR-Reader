# SPR

Concentration has never been my strong point, that being said; programming requires concentration and reading, 
and I am a programmer, so why not create tooling which aides me in my work and makes my life easier.

That is how SPR came about, influenced by [Stutter](), [Ratatui and Orhun's amazing work]() 
along with the likes of [TJ De'vries]() and [Neovim]() workflows.
The idea is that we need to read **a lot**, why not make it easier to do so on the command line.

**Key Features:**

- 📖 Speed reading with configurable WPM
- 🎯 Focus point highlighting (Spritz algorithm)
- 🖥️ Dual modes: fullscreen and inline (5-line viewport)
- 📊 Visual progress tracking
- ⏸️ Interactive pause/resume controls
- 🎨 Customizable colors and animations
- ⚙️ TOML-based configuration system
